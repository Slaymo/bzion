// Because BZiON uses `sass-media_query_combiner` to combine the media queries together, the order the media queries
// are placed are changed. To fix this issue, here are some dummy CSS rules that'll basically "trick" the SASS plug-in
// to order the media queries as specified here.

.media-query-setup {
    // These media query definitions should range from largest to smallest in a desktop-first website.

    @each $viewSize in map-keys($breakpoints-reversed) {
        @include respond-to($viewSize) {
            html:before {
